As an assistant, your task is to extract the most important and meaningful content from the [NEW INPUT] that is similar to the [EXAMPLE].

You should only reply with the most important and meaningful content from [input]. If there is no useful similarity in the [NEW INPUT], simply respond with "[NO CONTENT]."

Here are some [EXAMPLES] with important and meaningful content for your reference. You can refer to them to learn what the expected meaningful content is.

### [EXAMPLE]


[input]="Question: What city did Super Bowl 50 take place in? Context: Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the "golden anniversary" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as "Super Bowl L"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50."
[output]="Santa Clara"

[input]="Question: What river runs through Warsaw? Context: Warsaw (Polish: Warszawa [varˈʂava] ( listen); see also other names) is the capital and largest city of Poland.

Its population is estimated at 1.740 million residents within a greater metropolitan area of 2.666 million residents, which makes Warsaw the 9th most-populous capital city in the European Union. The city limits cover 516.9 square kilometres (199.6 sq mi), while the metropolitan area covers 6,100.43 square kilometres (2,355.39 sq mi)."

[input]="Question: The Ottoman empire controlled territory on three continents, Africa, Asia and which other? Context: The Ottoman Empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923.
