"What is the tallest mammal that can fly?"

"Flying mammals are an extraordinary group of creatures characterized by their ability to fly. They are a diverse and fascinating collection of animals, ranging in size, shape, and habitat. The largest mammal that can fly is the Andean condor, which is found in the Andean region of South America. The Andean condor can reach a wingspan of up to 3.1 meters (10 feet 2 inches) and a height of up to 1.06 meters (3 feet 6 inches) at the shoulder. Although it is a large bird, the Andean condor is actually classified as a mammal rather than a bird, as it has a unique set of characteristics that set it apart from other avian species. For example, it has a very long and strong neck, which allows it to reach and feed on carrion (dead animals) from a great height. The Andean condor is also a very social animal and lives in large groups, known as 'camas,' that can number from just a few to over 100 individuals. It is considered near threatened with extinction, mainly due to hunting and habitat loss."
